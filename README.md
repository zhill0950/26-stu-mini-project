# README for Mini Project

## Description

As a student in a bootcamp program I was tasked with creating a simple website utilizing some of the basic HTML and CSS skills we have been working on in class.

Some of these elements include the use of semantic HTML, the use of classes and IDs, creating an accessible website, and adding input fields with a button.
